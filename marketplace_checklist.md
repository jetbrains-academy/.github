# Marketplace course ready-for-publish checklist
Before publishing a course to the Marketplace, make sure that you can affirmatively respond to each point in this checklist.  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> We review courses to ensure that they align with this checklist.

## Mandatory
### Language requirements
- [ ] The course title is in English.
- [ ] At least the first sentence of the course description is written in English.
- [ ] The language of the course in `course-info.yaml` is correctly specified.

### Clear descriptions
- [ ] The first sentence of the course description is self-sufficient, concise, and provides useful information about the course.
- [ ] The course description field contains an easy-to-understand detailed course description.
- [ ] Course prerequisites are indicated at the beginning of the course.

### Technical requirements
- [ ] Make sure you use a [template](https://github.com/jetbrains-academy#templates) when creating your course, if one is available for your language/technology.
- [ ] Ensure all tests in [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/quickstart#viewing-your-workflow-results) pass, if you used a template that includes them.
- [ ] All tests for all course tasks pass. You can also [automate this check](https://blog.jetbrains.com/education/2022/10/27/edutools-plugin-2022-10-available/#ðŸ†•%C2%A0automatic-task-checking-for-new-courses) when creating the archive.
- [ ] The course contains more than 5 tasks.
- [ ] Tasks have a meaningful description, and the tests check the solution to the problem provided in the task description.
- [ ] Only the files needed by the user to solve the task are displayed in Course View. Other files (like images used in task.md, etc.) are [hidden](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10081-jetbrains-academy/docs/educator-start-guide.html#create_course) from the user so that they appear in the task description but not in the list of files in Course View.
- [ ] Only the plugins required for the course are listed in the course dependencies. Read more about managing required plugins [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/managing-plugins.html#required-plugins).

### Python
- [ ] `requirements.txt` contains all the [dependencies](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/managing-dependencies.html) required in the course.

### Gradle
- [ ] Modern-style configurations are used: `implementation` and `testImplementation` are used instead of `compile` and `testCompile`, respectively. As of Gradle 7.0, these configurations have been [removed](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/upgrading_version_6.html#sec:configuration_removal), and they can lead to errors during course project loading.

## Optional
### Formatting
- [ ] The `<code></code>` or/and backtick (&#96;) highlighting is really only used for code.
- [ ] All code insertions are highlighted with `<code></code>` or/and backtick.
- [ ] Multiple-line code blocks in `task.md` files are highlighted using Python syntax (&#96;&#96;&#96;text&#96;&#96;&#96;) instead of using single &#96;text&#96; code tags.
- [ ] `highlighting` is used to emphasize blocks of output.
- [ ] Images have a `width` [attribute](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_width.asp) in cases where images in the task description are too large.

### Code / text quality
- [ ] The text has been well proofread. (Optionally, we can offer our assistance with this. Please let us know if this works for you.)
- [ ] Code formatting follows the appropriate coding style for the language used, for example, [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/). The IDE can [perform code formatting](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/reformat-and-rearrange-code.html) for you.
